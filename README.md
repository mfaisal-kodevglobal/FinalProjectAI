Brief description of what the Project is doing:
The project involves working with a dataset of images featuring five distinct types of flowers. The primary objective is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately classify these flowers based on the input images. 
This classification task involves teaching the model to recognize the unique features and patterns that distinguish each type of flower. 
Through a systematic approach that includes data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation, the project aims to create a robust model capable of generalizing to new, unseen flower images. By leveraging convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures tailored for image classification, the project strives to achieve accurate and reliable predictions.
The overarching goal of the project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in categorizing flowers based on visual features. This not only showcases the potential of artificial intelligence in understanding and categorizing natural objects but also provides a foundation for future applications in areas like botany, agriculture, and environmental conservation.
